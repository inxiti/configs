# Configuration Files (Lorwyn)

These are primarily for my personal systems Lorwyn, Shadowmoor, and Morningtide.

Miscellaneous configs that need to be backed up somewhere, so why not here?

Configurations are for pretty much every program I use. Dotfiles are here.

Not really for useful for others.
